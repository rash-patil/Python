# Tools


Each of the folders is a specific application. It's a small contribution from my end to make things that I couldn't find as a free resource/tool. Tools are simple, so they can be used for small-scale applications.

Following is the way folders are structured.

 - [ ] Function : Where the code is present.[Not required for using the tool. Only if someone is intrested in the functioning can look into it]
 - [ ] Installation: Installation file and installation process is provided based on linux or windows os.
 - [ ] Sample: Sample files required and instruction of how to run it with the tool.

Feel free to use the tools. In case of bugs or improvment aspect feel free to raise an issue or mail me at Rashmipatil2101995rp@gmail.com. Will respond as soon as possible. All feedbacks and comments are apriciated.
